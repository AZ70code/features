<h2>Rating ★★★★★</h2>

In this plugin, I implemented the ability to leave a rating on the site. You can select a score with the mouse in the range from 1 to 5, or enter a score in increments of 0.1. Currently all scores are stored in a variable, but it is possible to add the ability to receive and send them to the server.
